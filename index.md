# Welcome!

Hey there! Welcome to Zeyu Li's Homepage!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at UCLA, advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang).
I am enthusiastic about applying cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to large scale data mining problems.
The goal of my research is to enable fast, accuarate, and elegant knowledge extraction and acquisition in real-life data
sources through modern machine learning technique.

Before joining UCLA at 2016, I got my BS in Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology under the supervision of 
[Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/pages/wang). I worked on data quality and data cleaning algorithms.
My CV is [here](./pdfs/cv.pdf).
